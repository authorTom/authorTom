# 👋 Hi, I'm Tom

I'm a registered nurse and clinical educator based in Birmingham, UK, with over 15 years of NHS experience. I’m passionate about using technology to improve clinical education, healthcare delivery, and the everyday experiences of patients and professionals.

## 💡 What I Do

- Lead clinical skills and simulation training across one of the UK’s largest NHS Trusts
- Design and deliver high-fidelity simulation programmes
- Develop and pilot digital learning tools and eLearning content
- Explore practical uses of AI, machine learning, and automation in clinical education

## 🧠 Areas of Interest

- AI in healthcare education (LLMs, RAG systems, automation)
- Simulation-based learning and scenario design
- Self-hosted tools, home labs, and open-source tech
- Digital innovation in clinical teaching and assessment

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools


🗃️ Languages & Markup
- Markdown – Documentation, slide decks, README writing
- YAML – Configuration for Docker, GitHub Actions, workflows
- Bash – Scripting for server and container automation
- HTML/CSS – Web content styling and layout
- Python (if applicable) – AI integration, utilities, automation

⚙️ Platforms & Frameworks
- Docker – Containerisation and orchestration of local and clinical apps
- Proxmox VE – Virtualisation and cluster management for home lab
- n8n – Visual automation and self-hosted workflows
- Moodle & Canvas – LMS platforms used in clinical education
- Unreal Engine – Interactive medical simulation and XR prototyping

🧠 AI & Machine Learning
- OpenAI API – Natural language processing and summarisation
- Whisper – Local speech-to-text transcription
- Local LLMs – Running large language models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) on local hardware
- RAG pipelines – Retrieval-augmented generation for contextual outputs
- Custom transcription workflows – Optimised for clinical debriefs and learning sessions
## 🔧 Current Projects

***AI-Assisted Debrief Summarisation***
- Developing a pipeline to record, transcribe, and summarise simulation-based clinical debriefs using local LLMs and Whisper. Aims to improve feedback quality and reduce educator workload.

***Home Data Centre & Self-Hosting Lab***
- Setting up a Proxmox-based mini data centre to run AI tools, containerised services, and simulation infrastructure. Includes work on Docker orchestration, backups, and virtual network design.
